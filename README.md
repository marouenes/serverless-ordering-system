# Serverless Ordering System

![Serverless-Architecture](/images/Serverless-Architecture.png)
## Overview

This is a project aiming at using Amazon Web Services products for building Data-Driven Serverless Applications with Kinesis. Data-driven applications have their application flow governed by the data, and the serverless framework can serve as the web framework to create this kind of application.

## Project Walkthough

- Designing an event-driven application
- Integrate **AWS Lambda and Kinesis streams** and set up necessary permissions.
- Discover how to leverage **[CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), and [more](https://aws.amazon.com/products/).**

## Topics Covered

* Backend as a service (BaaS)
* Function as a service (FaaS)
* Why infrastructure as code is so important
* Creating an order
* Setting up DynamoDB
* Saving into a DynamoDB table
* Using AWS SDK
* Sending a message to the stream
* Deploying and testing an application
* Cleaning up an AWS environment
